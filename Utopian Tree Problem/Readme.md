# Utopian Tree Problem :-

## *Description:*
The Utopian Tree goes through 2 cycles of growth every year. Each spring, it doubles in height. Each summer, its height increases by 1 meter. A Utopian Tree sapling with a height of 1 meter is planted at the onset of spring. How tall will the tree be after `n` growth cycles?

For example, if the number of growth cycles is `n = 5`, the calculations are as follows:

`Period  Height`

`0          1`
`1          2`
`2          3`
`3          6`
`4          7`
`5          14`

#### Sample Input:
`0
1
4`

### Sample Output:
`1
2
7`
