  # About Divisible-Sum-Pairs Problem

  --> Given an array of integers and a positive integer 'k', determine the number of (i,j) pairs where i < j and
  ar[i] + ar[j] is divisible by 'k'.

   # Example
   ar = {1,2,3,4,5,6} 
   k = 5
   Three pairs meet the criteria: [1,4],[2,3] and [4,6]
    (0,3) -> ar[0] + ar[3] = 1+4 = 5
