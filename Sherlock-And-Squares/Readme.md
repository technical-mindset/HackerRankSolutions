# _Description_ :-
Watson likes to challenge Sherlock's math ability. He will provide a starting and ending value that describe a range of integers, inclusive of the endpoints. Sherlock must determine the number of square integers within that range.

> #### Note:
> A square integer is an integer which is the square of an integer, e.g. `1, 4, 9, 16, 25`.

> ## Example :-
>`a = 24`
>`b = 49`\
> There are three square integers in the range: `25, 36` and `49`. Return `3`.



> ## Sample Input :-
> 1. `3`, `9`
> 2. `17`, `24`


> ## Output :-
