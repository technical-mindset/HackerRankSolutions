# Problem Description :-
Given an array of integers, find the longest subarray where the absolute difference between any two elements is less than or equal to  `1`.

## Example:
* a = [1, 1, 2, 2, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5]

There are two subarrays meeting the criterion: `[1, 1, 2, 2]` and `[4, 4, 5, 5, 5]`. The maximum length subarray has `5` elements.

## Returns:
* int: the length of the longest subarray that meets the criterion.

### Sample Input
`1 2 2 3 1 2`
### Sample Output
`5`
